##### Lab Assignment 4: Stack and Queue

##### Instructions:

##### 1. Unless not specified, on a queue only enqueue () and dequeue() operations can

##### be done. Similarly, on a Stack only Push() and Pop() operations can be done.

##### 2. For singly linked list follow the same structure of the node as discussed in the class.

##### 3. All the values has to be taken from user. For example, size of array or linked list or stack or queue, elements of the stack or queue.

##### Deadline: 30th October 2020

1. Write a program to implement a Stack using array. In order to implement the stack, program
for following stack operations has to be written:
- void push(int): to insert data onto the stack.
- Int pop(): to remove and return the last inserted element from the stack.
- Int top(): Returns the last inserted element without removing it.
- int Size(): Returns the number of elements stored in the stack.
- int IsEmptyStack(): Indicates whether any elements are stored in the stack or not.
- int IsFullStack(): Indicates whether the stack is full or not.

2. Implement the stack using linked list. Repeat the stack operations mentioned in Question 1.
---
3. Write a program to convert an infix expression to postfix. Here, input should be a string and
output should also be a string. For example, if input is ''(A+B)*(A-B)'' then output will be
''AB+AB-*''. You have to use only following operators: +, -,*, / and parenthesis as ().
---
4. Write a program to evaluate a postfix expression-using stack. Here, input will be a string but
output will be a numeric value such as integers, float etc. For example, if the postfix
expression (as input) is ''123*+5-'' then output will be 2. You have to use only following
operators: +, -,*, / in the postfix expression.

5. Given an array of characters formed with a’s and b’s. The string is marked with special
character X which represents the middle of the list (for example: ababa...ababXbabab baaa).
Check whether the string is palindrome or not using stack.

6. Write a program to implement Queue using circular array.
---
7. Write a program to implement Queue using linked list.
---
8. Write a program to implement Queue using two stacks.
---
9. Write a program to implement Stack using two queues.
---
10. Given an integer k and a queue of integers, how do you reverse the order of the first k
elements of the queue, leaving the other elements in the same relative order? For example, if
k=4 and queue has the elements [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]; the output should be [40,
30, 20, 10, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]. Here, you can use an auxiliary stack.
